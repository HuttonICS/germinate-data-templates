# Pedigree data

## Tabs

### DATA
This tab is used if you know the individuals used to create each germplasm. Please note, that all parents also have to exist in the Germinate database. If you don't want them to be part of the database, please use the `DATA-STRING` tab instead where you can provide the pedigree string in any notation like Lamacraft or Purdy.

Germplasm is defined as rows starting from `A2` downwards. Please use the `ACCENUMB` field from the germplasm MCPD standard to identify the material.
`ACCENUMB`, `Pedigree Description` and at least `Parent 1 ACCENUMB` are required columns. `Parent 2 ACCENUMB` can also be used if known.

### DATA-STRING
Germplasm is defined as rows starting from `A2` downwards. The `Pedigree string` and `Pedigree Notation` columns are required.

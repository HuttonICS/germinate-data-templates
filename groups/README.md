# Group data
Groups are subsets of germplasm, markers or locations that can be defined and stored in the database. These groups are used during data visualization and export to subset the data.
Each tab has the same structure:

The first column, starting from A4 down, contains the item identifier. See the sections further down to find out which identifier to use.

The first row, starting from B1 to the right, contains the name of the group.

The second row, starting from B2 to the right, contains the visibility of the group. "public" means that this group will be visible to everyone else, while setting it to "private" will hide this group from everyone except the person uploading this data template.

To indicate which item should be added to each group, use the intersection cells between the item row and the group column and fill it with an "x" letter.

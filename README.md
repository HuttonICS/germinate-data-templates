# Germinate Data Templates

This repository contains the data templates used to import data into Germinate. You will find a folder for each data type that currently supports data templates. Each of these contains its own README.md file that describes how the template can and should be used.

As a general tip: Please never remove or rearrange any existing columns/rows from the template. Additional columns should only be added in those templates that support it, e.g. trials data where traits can be added as columns.
